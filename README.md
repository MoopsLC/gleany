gleany
======

Gleany is a Scala game library wrapping [libgdx](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx). The library attempts (at the moment very poorly) to provide a more functionally pure wrapper for common functions as well as providing additional utilities to ease game making such as crash reporting, better audio management, resource loading, and saving of game settings.

Gleany is not meant for public consumption right now, but maybe at some point!
